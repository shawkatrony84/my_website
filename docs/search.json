My academic work spans machine learning, computational methods, and applied social data analysis.\nBefore graduate school, I worked on large-scale data and digital systems in the public sector, where I focused on improving data quality, analytics workflows, and information systems for decision-making.\nI’m especially interested in applications of machine learning, quantitative research, and public data to understand real-world problems. I enjoy working with Python, SQL, and visualization tools, and I’m always learning new methods and technologies in the data space.\nThanks for checking out my web site!"
