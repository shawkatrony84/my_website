:::{#me}
Hi, I’m Shawkat. I’m a data analytics practitioner currently completing an MS in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at UMass Amherst. My academic work spans machine learning, computational methods, and applied social data analysis.

Before graduate school, I worked on large-scale data and digital systems in the public sector, where I focused on improving data quality, analytics workflows, and information systems for decision-making.

I’m especially interested in applications of machine learning, quantitative research, and public data to understand real-world problems. I enjoy working with Python, SQL, and visualization tools, and I’m always learning new methods and technologies in the data space.
